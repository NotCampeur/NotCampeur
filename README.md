Oh, very good question myself! Well, I have been on the internet for 17 years-ish now.  
Flash games, forums and... well that's pretty much it, there wasn't much back at that time, but that was absolutely amazing what people could do.  
Internet always felt like my home, and this is where I want to share all my creations and gives people a good time

### <p align="center">Want to sponsor me?</p>

I am doing everything with my own ressources and fees are going to add up until the release of the project.  
It would be outstanding if you were to support me by any means possible.  
Only the following are available so far but I am thinking about Patreon, Ko-fi, Twitch and even github sponsors!
